# Gravity Torch

## A mod for Minecraft 1.7.10

This neat item, crafted by putting a regular torch onto a piece of cobblestone, drops when the block beneath it is mined.

It is very useful when you're pit-mining, where it saves you from having to replace broken toches all the time.

 

 

A note about rendering: The default settings should be safe, but if you experience the torch being invisible, go into the settings (ingame, using the mod settings menu). There are 4 different ways the item is rendered (as block in the world, as falling block, in the inventory, and in your hand) and you can set each one to be fast (direct drawing enabled) or compatible (disabled).
